Welcome to the informational site for the Lansing Homeschool Hackers.

The current focus of this site is FIRST LEGO League, specifically the 2021-2022 season.

## Core Values <small>([link](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/fll/core-values))</small>

The *FIRST* Core Values are the cornerstones of the program.
They are among the fundamental elements that distinguish *FIRST* LEGO League from other programs of its kind.
By embracing the Core Values, participants learn that friendly competition and mutual gain are not separate goals, and that helping one another is the foundation of teamwork.

We express the *FIRST* philosophies of *Gracious Professionalism* and *Coopertition* through our Core Values:

* **Discovery:** *We explore new skills and ideas.*
* **Innovation:** *We use creativity and persistence to solve problems.*
* **Impact:** *We apply what we learn to improve our world.*
* **Inclusion:** *We respect each other and embrace our differences.*
* **Teamwork:** *We are stronger when we work together.*
* **Fun:** *We enjoy and celebrate what we do!*
