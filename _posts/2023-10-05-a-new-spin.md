# A New Spin...

The team wanted to try out a gear arm that could be used to spin gears that were oriented horizontally. While this had the potential to complete some of the missions, it became very apparent that this attachment would take a high degree of accuracy to be successful.

In addition to the accuracy, the team noticed that the interplay between each gear and its neighbors introduced some "wiggle", and the more gears involved, the more wiggle there was in total. This became especially apparent when the team tried to attach a claw to the end, which when closed could be almost fully opened by gently pulling.

The team was glad to be able to learn a new technique, but might not use this attachment for competition.
