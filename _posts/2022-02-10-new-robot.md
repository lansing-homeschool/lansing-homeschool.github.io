The focus of this week was trying out a new robot design. After originally having a variation of the Spike Prime ["Driving Base 1"](https://education.lego.com/v3/assets/blt293eea581807678a/blte58422fa7d508a60/5f8802b882eaa522ca601c9f/driving-base-bi-pdf-book1of1.pdf), the team had discussed some challenges, in particular around having both a color sensor and lift arms attached at the same time. In response, the team spent the previous two weeks attempting different robot builds, eventually completing the ["Advanced Driving Base"](https://education.lego.com/en-us/lessons/prime-competition-ready/assembling-an-advanced-driving-base#lesson-plan). The new robot uses large motors for driving, rather than the medium motors, and it also uses larger tires. This required that the team do some experimenting with speed, power, and acceleration. By the end of practice the team was able to add some swing arms (side-to-side motion) to knock over the bridge pieces for [mission 14](https://firstinspiresst01.blob.core.windows.net/first-forward/fll-challenge/fll-challenge-cargo-connect-robot-game-rulebook.pdf). The team ended things by considering options for an arm that can move up and down, looking at the Spike Prime ["Lift Arm"](https://education.lego.com/v3/assets/blt293eea581807678a/blt61c6a675caa6e159/5f880275bf5ab07ee90076db/lift-arm-bi-pdf-book1of1.pdf) as an option.
