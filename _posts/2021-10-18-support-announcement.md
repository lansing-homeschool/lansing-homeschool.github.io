This year Ford offered several grants for FIRST in Michigan, and we were fortunate to be selected to receive one! The additional funding will help us cover the registration costs, and to purchase the SPIKE Prime Expansion set, which will allow the teams to build more complicated robot designs. This is very good news for our teams and we are very grateful to Ford for their support.
